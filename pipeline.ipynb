    "# Graph Agents\n",
    "* The specific short project aims to combine the concepts of **multiagent systems** and **knowledge graphs**.\n",
    "* A multiagent system (MAS) consists of multiple artificial intelligence (AI) agents working collectively to perform tasks on behalf of a user or another system ([IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/multiagent-system)).\n",
    "* A knowledge graph is an organized representation of real-world entities and their relationships. It is typically stored in a graph database, which natively stores the relationships between data entities ([Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/blog/what-is-knowledge-graph/)).\n",
    "* The idea behind combining multiagent systems with knowledge graphs is to **enhance query answering** by leveraging the **agents' specialized reasoning capabilities** and the **knowledge graph's structured semantic relationships**, enabling more accurate, context-aware, and scalable solutions.\n",
    "* The specific implementation consists of 3 steps:\n",
    "    1. *Creation of the knowledge graph*: this is done with [GraphRAG](https://github.com/microsoft/graphrag).\n",
    "    2. *Saving the graph in a database*: a [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) graph database is used.\n",
    "    3. *Building the multiagent system for question answering*: using [autogen](https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Acknowledgements\n",
    "* Three resources influenced the implementation:\n",
